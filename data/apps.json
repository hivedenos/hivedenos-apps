        "description": "⚠️ Make sure to only use named Docker volumes for your containers and projects. Data in bind-mounted volumes will be lost when the Arcane app is restarted or updated.\n\n\n⚠️ Watch out for port conflicts between your custom Docker containers and your umbrelOS apps.\n\n\nArcane is a powerful and modern container management platform designed to simplify the way developers interact with Docker environments. It provides a seamless and visually appealing interface that brings all aspects of container management together in one place. Users can create, start, stop, and inspect containers, explore networks, manage images, and handle volumes with precision and control.\n\n\nBeyond basic management, Arcane enhances productivity by offering integrated tools that developers typically rely on during their daily workflows. Its built-in terminal allows direct interaction with running containers, while the embedded code editor enables quick configuration or script adjustments without switching to external applications. Real-time system insights and detailed logging give users a clear view of their infrastructure's performance and resource usage.\n\n\nThe platform is designed to bridge the gap between simplicity and advanced control. It combines a clean, modern design with powerful backend capabilities, making it equally suitable for developers experimenting locally and professionals managing larger setups. With Arcane, managing containers feels more like using a well-crafted development environment than an administrative dashboard, allowing users to focus on building and running applications instead of dealing with complex Docker commands.\n\n\n🧩 Arcane on Umbrel is designed for advanced users who want complete control over their containers. Follow these recommendations to ensure a reliable and stable experience.  \n\n\n1. Persistent data: Always use named Docker volumes for your containers and projects. Any data stored in bind mounts will be lost when the Arcane app is updated or restarted.  \n\n\n2. Port usage: Be mindful of port conflicts between your containers, Umbrel system services, and other installed or future apps. Assign unique port numbers to prevent conflicts.  \n\n\n3. Restart behavior: Configure your containers with the restart policy set to unless stopped or always. This ensures they automatically restart after Arcane restarts or updates.  \n\n\n4. Web access: You can access any container that exposes a web interface at `umbrel.local:PORT_NUMBER`. For example, if your app runs on port 5050, open `http://umbrel.local:5050` in your browser.",

It would really make sense for this to be integrated directly into umbrelOS... hmmmmmmm.\n\n\nIntroducing Back That Mac Up — an official app by Umbrel.\n\n\nEffortlessly back up your Mac to your Umbrel using Time Machine. Simply follow the instructions in the app to set up your Umbrel as a Time Machine backup destination and you're good to go!\n\n\nMake sure to follow the instructions in the app to appropriately allocate the backup size. Time Machine backs up your Mac by keeping hourly backups for the past 24 hours, daily backups for the past month and weekly backups for all previous months.\nOver time, it will likely use all the allotted space on your Umbrel, automatically deleting the oldest backups to free up space as needed.\n\n\nFor seamless backups even when your Mac isn't connected to the same network as your Umbrel, simply install Tailscale on your Umbrel and your Mac, and use smb://umbrel as the server address.",

It eliminates the need for external uploads or online conversion services, ensuring that every action takes place locally and confidentially. This focus on privacy makes BentoPDF a secure alternative to traditional cloud-based PDF tools.\n\n\nAt its core, BentoPDF provides an extensive set of features for working with digital documents. Users can merge multiple PDFs into a single file, split them into separate sections, or reorganize individual pages in just a few clicks. The application allows rotating, duplicating, or removing pages with ease, offering full flexibility when editing complex documents. Visual adjustments such as background color changes, watermarks, headers, and footers can also be applied to enhance the appearance of professional documents.\n\n\nBentoPDF includes a robust conversion engine that supports transforming images into PDFs and exporting individual pages back into common image formats. It also enables file compression to optimize storage space without compromising quality. For document security, users can apply passwords, encrypt sensitive information, or remove existing restrictions to regain editing access. These tools make it suitable for both personal use and professional document preparation.\n\n\nAnother highlight is the integrated OCR functionality, which scans and recognizes text from image-based PDFs, turning them into fully searchable documents. Metadata editing options let users refine document properties and improve organization. With all these capabilities combined, BentoPDF offers a comprehensive, user-friendly environment for creating, editing, and managing PDFs efficiently — all while maintaining the highest level of privacy and control.",

        "description": "📖 BookLore is a modern web application created to transform the way digital libraries are managed and experienced. It is designed for readers who want to bring order and beauty to their collection of books and comics while also making them instantly accessible. Instead of leaving files scattered across folders, BookLore gathers them into a central library that can be explored and enjoyed directly through the browser. It provides a seamless reading environment where organization, discovery, and enjoyment flow together.\n\n\nOne of the most defining features of BookLore is its ability to automatically retrieve detailed information about each book. When a new file is added, the application fetches metadata such as title, author, description, and cover art, ensuring that the library always looks complete and polished. This automation removes the tedious task of entering details by hand and makes the collection feel like a professional archive. Users can browse their books with confidence that the information they see is accurate and visually appealing.\n\n\nOrganization is at the heart of the experience. Books can be sorted and displayed in a variety of ways, including by library, shelf, genre, author, or even mood. This flexibility allows each reader to create a system that matches personal habits and preferences, whether the goal is to maintain a precise catalog or to simply group titles in a way that feels natural. The interface encourages exploration and makes it easy to rediscover forgotten gems within the collection.\n\n\nReading itself is made enjoyable through the integrated BookLore reader, which supports popular formats such as PDF, EPUB, and CBZ. The reader is not only functional but also customizable, allowing themes and layouts to be adjusted so that each session feels comfortable. Whether someone prefers dark mode for nighttime reading or a lighter background during the day, the application adapts to the needs of the reader. This level of care ensures that the act of reading is always pleasant, no matter the device or environment.\n\n\nBookLore is also built for sharing and collaboration. It supports multiple users with individually assigned permissions, making it possible to create a communal library without giving up control. Some users can be allowed to upload and edit entries, while others may only be able to read or download. This approach makes the application suitable for families, reading groups, or anyone who wants to curate a shared space for books while maintaining order and consistency.\n\n\nAnother powerful element is the way BookLore integrates with external reading tools. Through support for OPDS, it can synchronize with many popular reader applications, allowing books to be accessed beyond the browser while still being part of the same collection. This flexibility ensures that the library feels connected and portable, no matter which reading environment is preferred.\n\n\nAdding new titles is effortless thanks to the BookDrop feature. Instead of manually managing file names and directories, users can simply place a book into a designated space, and BookLore automatically processes it, retrieves the correct metadata, and adds it to the collection. The process is smooth and requires almost no interaction, transforming what is usually a chore into a delightfully simple act.\n\n\nThe application also makes it easy to share individual books directly with others. With built in email functionality, a title can be sent straight to a recipient, which is especially useful for sending documents or transferring books to dedicated e reading devices such as a Kindle. This convenience bridges the gap between managing a collection and actually putting the books into the hands of readers.\n\n\nThe design of the interface is another strength of BookLore. It is responsive, intuitive, and built to adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring that browsing the library is equally pleasant on a phone, tablet, or desktop. The layout emphasizes clarity and usability, encouraging readers to engage with their collection in a way that feels natural and inviting.\n\n\nAt its core, BookLore is more than just a management tool. It is a thoughtful environment for digital reading that combines organization, automation, sharing, and customization into a single experience. By bringing together the functional needs of cataloging with the emotional enjoyment of reading, it helps transform a scattered set of files into a living, evolving library that is both beautiful and deeply personal.",

It was created to offer a privacy-focused and straightforward alternative to existing tracking tools, which are often cluttered with unnecessary features, complicated to set up, or designed for managing large, diversified portfolios. Many of those tools require connections to external services and the sharing of sensitive information such as wallet addresses or transaction histories.\n\n\nBTC Tracker takes a different approach. The entire application runs locally on your own device, with no data ever sent to external servers or third parties. All investment data, transactions, and settings are stored securely and privately on your machine, giving you full control over your personal information at all times. This makes BTC Tracker an ideal solution for anyone who values privacy and data ownership.\n\n\nBeyond simply recording investments, BTC Tracker provides powerful analysis features. Users can track the performance of their Bitcoin holdings over time, calculate profits and losses, and monitor their return on investment (ROI). The app supports multiple currencies, including EUR, USD, GBP, JPY, CHF, and PLN, allowing users to view their data in their preferred local currency.\n\n\nThe interface is modern and responsive, designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices. Users can choose between a light or dark theme depending on their visual preferences. BTC Tracker also includes CSV import and export features, making it easy to migrate data from other tools or create backups.\n\n\nOverall, BTC Tracker is a focused tool that puts privacy first and strips away unnecessary complexity. It gives you a clear, secure way to track your Bitcoin investments without compromising your data.\n\n\n⚠️ To use BTC Tracker, you need to create a user account. The application cannot function without it, as all data is securely linked to your personal profile and stored locally.",

        "description": "It allows nodes to protect themselves from being flooded with HTLCs. \nWith circuitbreaker a maximum to the number of in-flight HTLCs can be set on a per-peer basis.\nKnown and trusted peers for example can be assigned a higher maximum, while a new channel from a previously unseen node may be limited to only a few pending HTLCs.\nFurthermore it is possible to apply rate limits to the number of forwarded HTLCs. \nThis offers protection against DoS/spam attacks that rely on large numbers of fast-resolving HTLCs. \nRate limiting is implemented with a Token bucket. \nVia the UI the minimum interval between HTLCs can be specified.\nLarge numbers of HTLCs are also required for probing channel balances. \nReducing the information leakage through probing could be another reason to put in place a rate limit for untrusted peers.\n\n\nOperating modes\n\n\nThere are multiple modes in which circuitbreaker can operate. A default mode and per-peer overrides can be configured via the web ui:\n\n\n- fail: Fail back HTLCs when limits are exceeded. This minimizes the lock-up of liquidity on the incoming side, but does affect your reputation as a routing node.\n\n\n- queue: Queue HTLCs when limits are exceeded. Items are popped from the queue when the number of pending HTLCs is below the maximum and the rate limit allows another forward. This mode penalizes upstream nodes for the bad traffic that the deliver by locking up liquidity along the route. This may push upstream nodes to install a firewall too and constrain the mishaving node.\n\nEven in case of circuit breaker malfunction, queue mode should never cause channel force closes because of lnd's built-in protection that auto-fails HTLCs that aren't resolved.\n\nWARNING: Auto-fail is not yet released and scheduled for lnd 0.16. With earlier lnd versions, you risk force-closes!\n\n\n- queue_peer_initiated: This mode is also queuing HTLCs, but only those that come in through channels for which we aren't the channel open initiator. Not being the initiator means that the remote node is carrying the cost of a potential force-closure with stuck HTLCs. For channels that we initiated, the safer fail mode is used.\n\n- blocked: This mode blocks all incoming traffic from a peer.\n\nWARNING: See queue mode warning.",

        "description": "⚙️ Please read the important setup instructions at the bottom of this page.\n\n\nDATUM (Decentralized Alternative Templates for Universal Mining) is a brand new bitcoin mining protocol that allows you to create your own block templates using your own Bitcoin node.\n\n\nWith DATUM on Umbrel, you gain full control over your Bitcoin mining setup, allowing you to use your own Bitcoin node to generate custom block templates and directly issue work to your miners.\nDATUM enables you to either solo mine or participate in pool mining while optimizing block creation without relying on third-party servers.\n\n\nOver the years, mining has drifted toward centralization, with large pools dominating the process and reducing miners to mere sellers of hash power.\nDATUM seeks to bring back the core principle of Bitcoin: decentralization, giving miners direct control over the block construction process once again.\n\n\n🛠️ SET-UP INSTRUCTIONS\n\n\n### Bitcoin Node:\n\n\nDatum connects automatically to your Bitcoin Knots app upon installation. A full archival node is not required for mining, so you may wish to prune your node to save disk space. You can adjust this setting under Advanced Settings in the Bitcoin Knots app.\n\n\n### Configuring DATUM:\n\n\n⚠️ The DATUM team is aware that Safari currently cannot be used to change configuration settings within the app. Please use a different browser to change settings.\n\n\nIn order for DATUM to be fully initialized, you need to add your Bitcoin address in the \"Config\" tab within the DATUM app.\nThis is the default address that mining rewards will be sent to. Your in-app credentials needed to change settings can be found by\nright-clicking on the DATUM app icon from your umbrelOS homescreen and selecting \"Show default credentials\".\n\n\n### Connecting Your Miner:\n\n\nRefer to your miner's documentation for specific setup details. Here's a general guide to connect your miner with Datum:\n\n  - Stratum URL/Host/Pool: Use your umbrelOS device’s IP address (found in Settings on the umbrelOS home screen) and port 23334.\n  e.g., stratum+tcp://192.168.4.56:23334\n\n  - Username/Worker: Enter the Bitcoin address for receiving OCEAN rewards. Optionally, add a worker name after a period to identify your miner.\n  e.g., bc1qabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz or bc1qabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.bitaxe\n\n  - Password: Leave blank or enter any value if your miner requires a password.\n\n\nFor more information on Datum, please visit https://github.com/OCEAN-xyz/datum_gateway",

It has an interactive editor for compose files and can convert docker run commands into docker-compose.yaml.\n\n\n🛠️ Dockge on Umbrel is for power users, follow these best practices to avoid issues:\n\n\n1. Data persistence: Make sure to only used named Docker volumes in your Compose files. Data in bind-mounted\nvolumes will be lost when Dockge is restarted or updated.\n\n\n2. Port management: Watch out for potential port conflicts between your custom containers and umbrelOS' service containers,\napps you have installed from the Umbrel App Store or Community App Stores, and any apps you go to install in the future.\n\n\n3. Container restart policy: Set your containers to \"unless-stopped\" or \"always\" restart policies. This will allow your containers\nto restart automatically when Dockge is restarted or updated.\n\n\n4. Web access to containers: Access your custom containers in your browser at umbrel.local:PORT_NUMBER.

Element provides a new level of security, adding cross-signed device verification to default end-to-end encryption.\n\n  - The very best end-to-end encryption and Element's unique cross-signed device verification means only those that should be in the conversation can read the messages - no eavesdroppers or imposters.\n\n  - Most important of all, Element is open; built on the Matrix network, it connects to all other Matrix-based apps as well as bridging into proprietary systems. You can stay in Element while talking to friends and family in other apps.\n\n  - Element is open source. You know exactly what you're getting. Full transparency, the freedom to extend and customise with the support of a vibrant community of developers.\n\n\n🛠️ Getting Started\n\n\nAn easy way to get started is to install the \"Synapse\" app on your Umbrel. Synapse is a Matrix homeserver that stores all your personal chat history and user account information.\n\n\nWhen you register or login through Element, you will need to change the address of the homeserver you are logging into from the default matrix.org to http://umbrel.local:8008 for local access.\n\n\nFor seamless connection even when you are accessing Element away from home, simply install the \"Tailscale\" app on your Umbrel and your device you are using to access Element, and use http://umbrel:8008 as the address of your server.",

It acts as a central hub for all your digital media, automatically organizing content and enriching it with metadata like cover art, descriptions, and ratings. Emby provides a clean and intuitive interface that allows users to easily browse and play their media, whether they are at home or on the go.\n\n\nThe system supports a broad array of devices including smart TVs, smartphones, tablets, computers, streaming boxes, and game consoles. It offers live TV functionality and DVR support if compatible tuner hardware is connected. One of Emby's standout features is its ability to transcode media in real time, adjusting video quality and format to suit the capabilities of the device being used and the speed of the internet connection.\n\n\nEmby includes user management tools that allow families to create separate accounts with customized access restrictions and parental controls. This is particularly useful for households with children, as it helps tailor the media experience based on age and content preferences.\n\n\nEmby is often compared to other media servers like Plex and Jellyfin. Unlike Jellyfin, which is fully open source, Emby transitioned to a proprietary license, which led to the creation of Jellyfin as a community-driven fork. Despite this, Emby continues to develop rapidly and maintains a strong user base thanks to its blend of ease of use, rich feature set, and professional polish.\n\n\nIn summary, Emby is an ideal solution for anyone looking to take full control of their media library and stream it seamlessly across different devices while maintaining a personalized and private environment.",

        "description": "✏️ Excalidraw is a free and open-source virtual whiteboard that allows users to create diagrams, sketches, and visual concepts in a hand-drawn style. Designed to simulate the look of informal sketches, it offers a playful yet functional way to visualize ideas, plan projects, and collaborate with others. Unlike traditional diagramming tools that aim for polished, rigid layouts, Excalidraw embraces rough edges and fluid lines, making it ideal for creative thinking, brainstorming sessions, and rapid prototyping.\n\n\nAt its core, Excalidraw is built for simplicity and ease of use. Users can draw shapes like rectangles, circles, and arrows, add text, and use a freehand tool to sketch ideas. The interface is intuitive and minimalist, allowing even those with no prior design experience to jump in and start drawing immediately. It supports real-time collaboration, enabling multiple people to work together on the same canvas simply by sharing a link. This feature makes it a popular choice for remote teams, educators, and facilitators who need a shared visual space for interaction.\n\n\nOne of the standout features of Excalidraw is its offline capability. As a progressive web app, it works directly in the browser and saves data locally, so users can keep working even without an internet connection. It also supports exporting drawings in multiple formats, including PNG, SVG, and JSON, which makes it easy to use content created in Excalidraw elsewhere.\n\n\nBecause it is open source, Excalidraw has gained a strong developer following. The codebase is available on GitHub, allowing contributors to extend its features or integrate it into other platforms. This flexibility has led to its adoption in tools like Obsidian, Visual Studio Code, and various project management environments, where visual collaboration is a valuable asset.\n\n\nOverall, Excalidraw stands out as a lightweight, accessible, and community-driven alternative to more complex design and diagramming software. Its focus on clarity, collaboration, and the freedom to draw without friction makes it a beloved tool for thinkers, tinkerers, and teams around the world.",

It allows groups of trusted individuals, \ncalled guardians, to jointly operate a multi-signature e-cash mint.\n\n# Setting Up a Federation\n\nYou can create a Fedimint in two ways:\n\n  - Single Guardian Federation — A single guardian operating their own mint.\n\n  - Group Federation — Multiple guardians running the mint together (minimum of 4 guardians).\n\n[See here for more deployment recommendations](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/blob/master/docs/deploying.md)\n\n# Step By Step Ceremony\n\n1. Install & Launch this Fedimint app (fedimintd) on your Umbrel\n   Each participating guardian runs their own instance of fedimintd.\n\n2. Set a Password\n   When starting fedimintd for the first time, each guardian must create a secure password.\n\n3. Generate Setup Code\n   After entering the password, a unique setup code is generated for each guardian.\n\n4. Exchange Setup Codes\n   All guardians must share their setup codes with each other (every guardian needs every other guardian's code).\n\n5. Distributed Key Generation (DKG)\n   Once all setup codes are entered, the DKG process begins. This is where the federation's cryptographic keys are jointly created.\n   This step may take some time while all guardians connect.\n\n6. Federation Complete!\n   Once DKG finishes, your federation is live. Your guardian dashboard will be available for monitoring. You now have a functioning Fedimint!\n\n# Enabling Lightning Payments\n\nFedimint supports Lightning payments via a Lightning Gateway. To use Lightning in your federation, there are two options:\n\n1. Use an existing Lightning Gateway. [Reach out on Discord to get setup](https://chat.fedimint.org).\n\n2. Run your own - [see Lightning Gateway docs for more information](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/blob/master/docs/gateway.md).",

This flexibility allows you to perform\nvarious actions on individual nodes or groups of selected nodes, including:\n- Creating new nodes\n- Starting or stopping nodes\n- Recycling nodes to generate a new peer ID\n- Removing nodes\n- Upgrading nodes when a new binary version is available\n- Viewing individual node logs in real time\n- Monitoring memory and CPU usage with detailed charts\n- Sorting nodes by different criteria, such as creation date, status, or number of connected peers\n\nThe Formicaio backend actively monitors your nodes, providing real-time\nstatus updates and statistics, including:\n- Rewards balance for each node\n- Memory and CPU usage\n- Number of records stored locally\n- Current peer connections\n- Peers in the routing table\n- Peers that have shunned the node(s)\n- Estimated total nodes in the network\n\n## Customizable monitoring and management\n\nA settings panel allows you to customize monitoring tasks and node management, including:\n- Auto-upgrading nodes when a new binary version is available\n- Delay settings for node upgrades\n- Frequency of version checks for the node binary\n- Frequency of token balance queries\n- Frequency of metrics and node information retrieval\n- Configuration of the ERC20 token contract address and RPC URL for reward balance queries\n\n## Connection types for nodes\n\nWhen setting up nodes, you can define their connection type and custom data directory:\n- UPnP support: Attempts to use UPnP to open a port on your home router for incoming connections. If your router doesn't support UPnP, create nodes with UPnP disabled to ensure connectivity.\n- Listening IP address: This address determines which network interface the node will bind to for incoming connections. The application supports both IPv4 (e.g., `0.0.0.0`, `127.0.0.1`) and IPv6 (e.g., `::`, `fe80::1`) addresses, allowing users to control whether the node is accessible on all interfaces, only locally, or on a specific network. This flexibility is useful for running nodes in different environments, such as local development, private networks, or public-facing deployments.\n- Custom data directory: This directory is where the node will store its persistent data, such as chunks, logs, and configuration files. By assigning a unique data directory to each node, or batch of nodes, users can run multiple nodes on the same machine without data conflicts. This option is especially valuable for advanced setups or when running nodes with different hard disks or mounting points.",

        "description": "🦞 Homarr is a modern self-hosted dashboard designed to help users manage and organize their web applications and services in one central place. It acts as a personalized homepage accessible through a web browser, allowing individuals to have quick and easy access to all their important links, servers, containers, and APIs. This makes it especially useful for people who run multiple services on their own servers or devices and want a clean, unified interface to interact with them.\n\n\nThe main purpose of Homarr is to provide an intuitive and visually appealing overview of various self-hosted services. Users can create customizable cards or tiles representing different applications or endpoints. These tiles can be arranged to suit personal preferences, making it simple to find and launch the desired service without having to remember multiple URLs or manage numerous bookmarks. The dashboard offers flexibility in design, allowing adjustments in layout, colors, and icons to match the user's style or to improve usability.\n\n\nBecause Homarr is self-hosted, it gives users full control over their data and environment. It can be deployed on devices such as home servers, network-attached storage systems, or virtual private servers. Security features can be enabled to restrict access to authorized users only, which ensures that the dashboard and the linked services remain protected from unauthorized use.\n\n\nHomarr is particularly appealing to tech enthusiasts, system administrators, and anyone who manages a complex setup of self-hosted applications. It reduces the hassle of navigating through different interfaces and provides a streamlined experience for monitoring and accessing services. By consolidating everything into a single, easy-to-use interface, Homarr improves productivity and organization.\n\n\nIn summary, Homarr is a customizable and secure dashboard solution for individuals looking to centralize access to their self-hosted web applications. It enhances convenience by offering a visually structured and personalized entry point to a variety of online services and tools.",

This makes it ideal for quick reminders, to-do items, or planning events as a group. The shopping list tool adds another layer of convenience by allowing real-time collaboration when preparing for grocery trips. Each item can be checked off instantly, keeping everyone informed and avoiding duplicate purchases.\n\n\nThe app also includes a detailed chore tracker that helps assign and manage household tasks. Members can track who is responsible for cleaning, laundry, or other recurring duties, making it easier to maintain balance and accountability in a shared living space. For financial organization, HomeHub integrates an expense tracker that records shared payments, monthly bills, and subscriptions, helping users see where their money goes and how costs are split.\n\n\nBeyond task and finance management, HomeHub adds small but practical utilities that enhance everyday life. A recipe book allows users to save favorite meals for easy access, while an expiry date tracker helps prevent food waste by reminding users when items are close to expiration. There is also a lightweight link shortener for simplifying URLs, a PDF compressor for managing documents, and a QR code generator for quick sharing.\n\n\nThe interface of HomeHub is designed with clarity and simplicity in mind. Everything is presented in an elegant and minimal layout that feels intuitive to use, even for those who are not tech-savvy. Its focus is on reducing clutter and creating a pleasant digital space where every family member can contribute equally.\n\n\nIn essence, HomeHub turns household management into a shared, transparent, and collaborative experience. It helps people stay informed, organized, and connected with one another, transforming the routine of daily coordination into something smooth, accessible, and even enjoyable.",

        "description": "InfluxDB is an open-source, high-performance time series database packaged with Chronograf, the official web-based visualization tool.\r\nBuilt specifically for handling high-frequency data, InfluxDB excels at managing and analyzing large volumes of timestamped information.\r\n\r\n\r\n⚠️ Default admin credentials are provided for advanced CLI access. Chronograf is pre-configured with these credentials and requires no additional setup.\r\nTo find these credentials you can right-click on the InfluxDB app icon from your umbrelOS homescreen and select \"Show default credentials\".\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy use InfluxDB?\r\n\r\n\r\n**🚀 High Performance**\r\n\r\nInfluxDB is a high-performance data store written specifically for time series data. It allows for high throughput ingest, compression and real-time querying.\r\n\r\n\r\n**💡 SQL-Like Queries with InfluxQL**\r\n\r\nInfluxDB works with InfluxQL, a SQL-like query language for interacting with data.\r\nIt has been lovingly crafted to feel familiar to those coming from other SQL or SQL-like environments while also providing features specific to storing and analyzing time series data.\r\nInfluxQL supports regular expressions, arithmetic expressions, and time series-specific functions to speed up data processing.\r\n\r\n\r\n**📦 Efficient Data Retention and Downsampling**\r\n\r\nInfluxDB can handle millions of data points per second. Working with that much data over a long period can lead to storage concerns.\r\nInfluxDB automatically compacts data to minimize your storage space.\r\nIn addition, you can easily downsample the data; keeping high-precision raw data for a limited time and storing the lower-precision, summarized data for much longer or until the end of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n**📊 Integrated Visualization with Chronograf**\r\n\r\nChronograf is the administrative user interface and visualization engine of the stack. It makes it easy to setup and maintain the monitoring and alerting for your infrastructure.\r\nIt's simple to use and includes templates and libraries that allow you to rapidly build dashboards with real-time visualizations of your data and to easily create alerting and automation rules.\r",

Fund the ItchySats wallet\n\n2. Open a position\n\n3. Monitor the price movement\n\n4. Profit\n\n\nLimitations of the mainnet beta:\n\n\n1. Minimum position quantity is $100, maximum $1000\n\n\nWith 0.4.0 your CFDs are perpetual positions that are extended hourly. This means your CFD position will remain open forever unless you decide to close it. A funding fee is collected hourly when the CFD is extended.\n\n\nWith 0.4.8 you can open long and short positions, previously only long positions were possible.\n\n\nWith 0.5.0 you can chose from different from leverage. Leverage choices are configured by the maker and might initially be restricted to x1, x2 and x3.\n\nWith 0.6.0 you can open positions on BTCUSD and ETHUSD prices. #ShortTheMerge\n\nWith 0.7.0 we replaced basic authentication with cookie-based authentication. Deterministic password is the same as before (see Umbrel app store).",

        "description": "⚙️ It-Tools is an open-source project hosted on GitHub that provides a collection of practical online tools for developers and IT professionals. The tools are designed to be easy to use, offering a great user experience. The project includes various features that simplify common tasks, such as URL decoding, QR code generation, JSON formatting, and XML formatting.\n\n\nA key feature of the project is the ability to self-host the application. Users can run the tools on their own servers using Docker, which is especially useful for developers who want an independent environment. The Docker installation process is simple, requiring only a straightforward command to run the application in the background.\n\n\nIt-Tools is actively developed and maintained, with regular updates and contributions from the community. It is licensed under the GNU GPLv3, allowing users to freely use, modify, and share the project. The GitHub repository has garnered a large and active community that discusses the tools' usefulness and potential improvements. The project is particularly appreciated in offline environments since it can be self-hosted. Additionally, there have been suggestions to add more features, such as Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments.\n\n\nThe collection offers developers a fast and efficient way to perform common tasks directly in their browser without needing external tools or services. The self-hosting option makes it particularly appealing for users who want complete control over their tools and data.",

        "description": "Jackett works as a proxy server: it translates queries from apps (Sonarr, Radarr, SickRage, CouchPotato, Mylar3, Lidarr, DuckieTV, qBittorrent, Nefarious, etc) into tracker-site-specific http queries,\nparses the html or json response, and then sends results back to the requesting software. This allows for getting recent uploads (like RSS) and performing searches.\nJackett is a single repository of maintained indexer scraping & translation logic - removing the burden from other apps.\n\n\n🛠️ SET-UP INSTRUCTIONS\n\n\n1. Base URL Configuration: In Jackett, fill in the \"Base URL override\" with \"http://[the-ip-of-your-umbrel]:9117\" without the quotes and replace with the IP of your Umbrel device.\nYou can find your device's IP address by visiting your router's admin dashboard or by using an IP scanning tool like Angry IP Scanner.\nThis ensures that functionalities like copying a Torznab feed URL to your clipboard work correctly for integration with apps like Sonarr and Radarr.\n\n\n2. Blackhole Directory: If you want to download .torrent files directly from Jackett and have a torrent client watch this folder, set the \"Blackhole directory\" in Jackett to \"/downloads\" without the quotes. This will allow you to download .torrent files from Jackett to your Umbrel's downloads folder.\n\n\n3. App Integration: Follow the instructions within Jackett to integrate Jackett as an indexer source for apps like Sonarr and Radarr.",

        "description": "👨‍🍳 KitchenOwl is a self-hosted, open-source application designed to simplify household management, particularly when it comes to organizing groceries, recipes, meal planning, and shared expenses. Built with privacy and usability in mind, KitchenOwl empowers individuals, families, and shared households to collaboratively manage kitchen-related tasks through a sleek and intuitive interface available on mobile, desktop, and the web.\n\n\nThe app allows users to create and maintain dynamic shopping lists that can be shared and edited in real time. As users add items to the list, KitchenOwl automatically categorizes them and even learns from shopping habits to improve future suggestions. This makes weekly shopping more efficient and less prone to forgetting essential items. Items can be checked off as they're purchased, and multiple lists can be maintained simultaneously to accommodate different stores or household needs.\n\n\nAnother key feature of KitchenOwl is its recipe management functionality. Users can manually add their own recipes or import them from popular websites using a built-in recipe parser. Recipes are stored in a centralized digital cookbook and can be searched or filtered by tags, ingredients, or categories. When planning meals, users can simply add a recipe's ingredients to their shopping list with a single click, streamlining the preparation process.\n\n\nMeal planning is seamlessly integrated, allowing users to schedule meals for upcoming days or weeks. This feature not only helps in maintaining a balanced diet but also reduces food waste by encouraging the use of ingredients already on hand. KitchenOwl even nudges users to revisit recipes they haven't used in a while, bringing forgotten favorites back into rotation.\n\n\nFor shared living situations, KitchenOwl includes expense tracking capabilities. Household members can log expenses related to grocery shopping or other communal costs, and the app helps divide those expenses fairly among the group. This reduces the friction often associated with shared finances and ensures transparency within the household.\n\n\nKitchenOwl is actively developed and maintained by a community of contributors who prioritize open access and user feedback. The project welcomes new users and developers alike to participate, offering detailed documentation and support to help anyone get started. With its thoughtful design and robust feature set, KitchenOwl provides a comprehensive solution for modern, collaborative kitchen management.",

        "description": "🦎 Komodo is an open-source platform focused on streamlining and automating the management of servers, application builds, deployments, and containerized environments. It offers a unified interface that enables users to monitor critical system metrics such as CPU load, memory consumption, and disk usage across multiple servers, providing comprehensive operational visibility. A key feature of Komodo is its ability to manage Docker containers and Docker Compose applications, delivering real-time insights into their status, logs, and uptime. This detailed container management simplifies troubleshooting and operational oversight, making it easier for teams to maintain and optimize their deployments.\n\n\nBuilt on a core-periphery architecture, Komodo consists of a central control unit that coordinates with lightweight agents running on connected hosts. This structure allows for secure and scalable communication, enabling users to execute commands remotely, trigger automated builds and deployments, and access shell sessions across their infrastructure with ease. The platform's robust management of environment variables and secrets ensures sensitive information is handled securely and flexibly, supporting features like global variables and secret interpolation.\n\n\nKomodo exposes extensive REST and WebSocket APIs that empower teams to automate workflows, integrate with external tools, and customize infrastructure management processes programmatically. It also supports multi-user authentication with role-based access controls and OAuth integration, ensuring secure collaboration within teams. As a powerful alternative to Portainer, Komodo consolidates monitoring, deployment, and management capabilities into a single platform, helping organizations increase efficiency, reduce manual overhead, and maintain clear oversight of their distributed environments.

        "description": "> \"[Bitcoin] takes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread but hard to stifle.\" - Satoshi Nakamoto\n\n\nWhile Bitcoin Core's mempool policies have been loosened over the years, there still remains some paternalism in what kinds of transactions Bitcoin Core allows. For example, Bitcoin Core maintains the pointless OP_Return size limit, even though it's just one of many ways to publish data in Bitcoin transactions; Libre Relay doesn't. Additionally, there's been constant pressure on Core to block more types of transactions for various reasons, such as censoring \"spam\".\n\n\nLibre Relay is a fork of Bitcoin Core that does two things:\n  - Removes paternalistic transaction filtering.\n  - Peers with other Libre Relay nodes to ensure transactions that would have been blocked by Core can reach miners such as F2Pool and MARA anyway.\n\nWhile this is of course good for people whose transactions are being blocked by Core, it's also good for Core itself: by having an alternative, when people try to pressure Core into blocking more transactions, Core can always point out that censorship doesn't work.\n\n\nFinally, Libre Relay is also being used to develop Replace-By-Fee-Rate, a transaction pinning solution that mitigates pinning attacks on L2 protocols in a simple and effective way.",

        "description": "🖼️ LibrePhotos is a photo management application that helps users organize and browse their photo and video collections with ease. It provides features like face recognition that automatically detects and groups people in photos to make searching simpler. The app uses artificial intelligence to identify objects and scenes in images, enabling users to perform semantic searches based on the content of their photos.\n\n\nIt supports a wide variety of file formats including RAW and HEIC and allows for automatic album creation based on events, dates, and locations. Users can explore their media chronologically through a timeline view and search their photos by metadata such as GPS coordinates and EXIF information.\n\n\nThe application also supports multi-user access with customizable permissions, enabling different users to interact with the photo library according to their roles. Additional features include reverse geocoding to assign place names to photo locations and an integrated mobile app that facilitates offline access and synchronization.\n\n\nOverall, LibrePhotos aims to provide a comprehensive, intelligent, and user-friendly way to manage large collections of photos and videos.\n\n\n⚠️ Initial setup may take 5-10 minutes depending on your hardware. Please be patient while LibrePhotos gets ready in the background.",

Our platform offers a website similar to Linktree, which allows users to overcome the limitation of only being able to add one link on social media platforms.\n\n\nWith LinkStack, users can easily link to their own custom page and provide their followers with access to all the links they need in one convenient location. What sets LinkStack apart from other link management platforms is its flexibility, which allows users to host their links on their own web server or web hosting provider. This provides users with complete control over their online presence and ensures that their links are easily accessible.\n\n\nAdditionally, LinkStack allows other users to register and create their own links, making it an ideal solution for businesses and organizations looking to manage multiple links. With our user-friendly Admin Panel, managing and accessing other users links is easy.\n\n\n☁️ You will need to expose the Linkstack app to the web in order to share your Linkstack webpage with others. The easiest way to do this is to use the 'Cloudflare Tunnel' app from the Umbrel App Store, and expose the Linkstack app using your own domain.\n\n\nWhy choose LinkStack?\n\n\n💡 Feature rich: LinkStack offers more features than any other comparable solution out there.\n\n\n⚙️ Easy to set up: LinkStack is user-friendly and easier to set up compared to similar web applications.\n\n\n👐 Open Source: LinkStack is free to use, distribute, and modify. The source code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/LinkStackOrg).",

Depending on your internet speed, it may take some time for it to be installed.\n\n\nLlamaGPT consumes approximately 5GB of RAM. As a result, it is not suitable for users running umbrelOS on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB RAM. For the best user experience, at least 8GB RAM is recommended.\n\n\nLlamaGPT is optimized for the Umbrel Home, generating words as fast as ~3 words/sec. On a Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB RAM, it generates words at ~1 word/sec. Performance can vary depending on which other apps are installed on your Umbrel.\n\n\nPowered by the state-of-the-art Nous Hermes Llama 2 7B language model, LlamaGPT is fine-tuned on over 300,000 instructions to offer longer responses and a lower hallucination rate.\n\n\nLlamaGPT has been made possible thanks to the incredible open source work from various developers and teams. We extend our gratitude to Mckay Wrigley for building the Chatbot UI, Georgi Gerganov for implementing llama.cpp, Andrei for developing the Python bindings for llama.cpp, NousResearch for fine-tuning the model, Tom Jobbins for quantizing the model, and Meta for releasing Llama 2 under a permissive license.\n\n\nAn official app from Umbrel.",

This helps prevent unexpected downtime caused by certificate issues.\n\n\nEach monitored endpoint can be configured with custom intervals, tags, and descriptions, allowing for flexible organization and categorization. You can group services by project, type, or any other criteria that fits your workflow.\n\n\nThe built-in alerting system notifies you when a service goes down or shows abnormal behavior so you can react immediately. Alerts are sent only when they matter to avoid unnecessary noise.\n\n\nLunalytics supports multiple users with role based access control, enabling teams to share dashboards while maintaining permission boundaries. Admins can invite users and assign roles to manage access levels effectively.\n\n\nAll monitoring data is displayed in real time through an intuitive and interactive dashboard. Historical charts and request logs allow for deeper analysis and help you spot trends or recurring issues over time.",

It provides access to a secure, sandboxed browser environment that runs independently of the user's local system, ensuring privacy and isolation. The browser is rendered remotely, and all interactions are transmitted in real time, resulting in a smooth and low-latency experience.\n\n\nDesigned with collaboration in mind, Neko allows multiple users to join and share the same session, making it ideal for activities like co-browsing, watch parties, or remote support. The interface is optimized for responsiveness, with minimal delay between input and feedback, creating an experience that feels native despite running remotely.\n\n\nWhen integrated into Umbrel, Neko offers a private and always-available browser instance that can be accessed securely from within the home network or over the internet through Umbrel's tunneling options. It fits seamlessly into the self-hosted ecosystem, providing a reliable and user-friendly way to browse the web without relying on third-party services or exposing your local device.\n\n\nNeko is especially useful in scenarios where privacy, simplicity, and ease of access are important - whether for personal use, collaborative tasks, or secure remote browsing.\n\n\n💡 Neko offers a wide range of configuration options, including WebRTC configuration, plugin settings, and audio & video capture.

        "description": "🌐 Networking Toolbox is a comprehensive suite of web-based utilities built to make network analysis, configuration, and troubleshooting more accessible. It brings together a wide range of technical functions that help professionals and enthusiasts understand and manage digital communication systems more efficiently. By combining analytical precision with an intuitive interface, it allows users to explore, calculate, and visualize complex network relationships in real time.\n\n\nAt its core, Networking Toolbox focuses on the essential building blocks of the internet and private networks. It provides tools for IP address management, subnet and CIDR calculations, and DNS diagnostics, helping users perform operations that would normally require multiple specialized applications. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6 standards, enabling users to test and validate configurations, identify errors, and understand how data flows between devices and services.\n\n\nThe application also offers capabilities for working with network security and performance. Users can inspect SSL and TLS certificates, verify domain configurations, analyze ports, and decode network headers to ensure that systems operate safely and efficiently. Each function is designed to deliver clear, accurate results without unnecessary complexity, allowing deeper technical insight into network infrastructure.\n\n\nNetworking Toolbox is ideal for anyone who needs to explore how networks function on a detailed level. Whether used for learning, debugging, or system optimization, it provides the necessary foundation for mastering the principles of networking and ensuring that every layer of communication remains transparent, reliable, and secure.",

For more information, visit the project's GitHub repository.\n\n\nNitter is a free and open source alternative Twitter front-end focused on privacy and performance.\n\n\nIt's impossible to use Twitter without JavaScript enabled. For privacy-minded folks, preventing JavaScript analytics and IP-based tracking is important, but apart from using a VPN and uBlock/uMatrix, it's impossible. Despite being behind a VPN and using heavy-duty adblockers, you can get accurately tracked with your browser's fingerprint, no JavaScript required. This all became particularly important after Twitter removed the ability for users to control whether their data gets sent to advertisers.\n\n\nUsing an instance of Nitter hosted on your Umbrel, you can browse Twitter without JavaScript while retaining your privacy. In addition to respecting your privacy, Nitter is on average around 15 times lighter than Twitter, and in most cases serves pages faster (eg. timelines load 2-4x faster).\n\n\nIn the future a simple account system will be added that lets you follow Twitter users, allowing you to have a clean chronological timeline without needing a Twitter account.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- No JavaScript or ads\n\n- All requests go through the backend, client never talks to Twitter\n\n- Prevents Twitter from tracking your IP or JavaScript fingerprint\n\n- Uses Twitter's unofficial API (no rate limits or developer account required)\n\n- Lightweight (for @nim_lang, 60KB vs 784KB from twitter.com)\n\n- RSS feeds\n\n- Themes\n\n- Mobile support (responsive design)\n\n- AGPLv3 licensed, no proprietary instances permitted",

Connect your Nostr client (e.g., Damus, Amethyst) to your private relay for seamless backup of all Nostr activity. In Damus, add your Relay URL via Menu > Relays.\n\n\nTip: Install Tailscale on your Umbrel and your devices for an uninterrupted connection between your clients and your relay, even when you're away from your home network. Enable Tailscale's MagicDNS and use ws://umbrel:4848 as your Relay URL.\n\n\nStep 2. Tap the globe icon on the top to back up past Nostr activity from your public relays and ensure uninterrupted future backups, even if the connection between your private relay and Nostr client is disrupted.\n\n\nThat's it! Your past and future Nostr activity will be now backed up to your private relay.\n\n\nNostr Relay is powered by the open source nostr-rs-relay project — a Rust implementation of Nostr relay. It currently supports the entire relay protocol, including NIP-01, NIP-02, NIP-03, NIP-05, NIP-09, NIP-11, NIP-12, NIP-15, NIP-16, NIP-20, NIP-22, NIP-26, NIP-28, and NIP-33.",

We use https://ntfy.sh for poll\nrequests by default. This doesn't send your notifications through this service, but instead only prompts your iOS device to\ndownload the notification from your local ntfy instance. Advanced users can remove the \"NTFY_UPSTREAM_BASE_URL\" environment variable from the Docker compose file if desired; however, this will disable instant notifications on iOS devices.\n\n\n🔔 Send push notifications from your app or script\n\nPublishing messages can be done via PUT or POST. Topics are created on the fly by subscribing or publishing to them.\nIf you use ntfy without sign-up, the topic is essentially a password, so pick something that's not easily guessable.\n\n\n📱 Receive notifications on your phone\n\nSubscribe to a topic and receive notifications, with different priorities, attachments, action buttons, tags & emojis,\nand even for automation.\n\n\n💻 Get notified on your computer\n\nYou can use the web app to subscribe to topics as well. If you do, notifications will pop up as desktop notifications.\nSimply type in the topic name and click the Subscribe button. The browser will keep a connection open and listen for\nincoming notifications.\n\n\n⚙️ Integrate with your favorite tools\n\nPublishing messages is just a HTTP request, so pretty much everything under the sun can integrate with ntfy. Hundreds\nof integrations, projects or scripts already support ntfy.",

For example, the API Base URL would be: http://ollama_ollama_1:11434.\n  - Custom Integrations: Connect Ollama to third-party apps or your own code using your UmbrelOS local domain (e.g., http://umbrel.local:11434) or your device's IP address, which you can find in the UmbrelOS Settings page (e.g., http://192.168.4.74:11434).",

        "description": "OpenReader WebUI is a web-based document reader that integrates text-to-speech (TTS) functionality, allowing users to listen to text from various document formats, including PDF and EPUB. Designed to enhance accessibility and improve the reading experience, it features synchronized text highlighting, ensuring that the currently read portion of the document is visually emphasized as the speech engine narrates the content. This makes it particularly useful for individuals with visual impairments, reading difficulties, or those who simply prefer an auditory learning style.\n\n\nThe application is built with compatibility in mind, supporting any OpenAI-compatible TTS backend, such as Kokoro-FastAPI and Orpheus-FastAPI. This allows users to select a preferred speech synthesis engine, offering flexibility in voice selection, pronunciation accuracy, and overall reading quality. By leveraging these backends, OpenReader WebUI can generate natural-sounding speech, making long-form reading more engaging and reducing the cognitive load associated with traditional reading.\n\n\nThe user interface is designed to be intuitive and lightweight, providing a seamless experience without unnecessary complexity. Users can upload documents directly through the web interface, control playback speed, pause and resume narration, and navigate through the document efficiently. The software aims to cater to a diverse audience, including students, professionals, and individuals with disabilities, ensuring that reading materials are more accessible to everyone.\n\n\nAdditionally, OpenReader WebUI is available as an open-source project, allowing developers to contribute to its improvement and expand its capabilities. A public demo is accessible online, enabling users to test its features without requiring installation, making it easy to evaluate its functionality before setting up a local instance. With a focus on usability and accessibility, OpenReader WebUI represents a modern approach to document reading, bridging the gap between text and speech in a user-friendly manner.\n\n\n⚠️ This app only works in Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Brave).",

        "description": "🖼️ Picsur is a lightweight, self-hosted image hosting platform designed for simplicity and control. It allows users to upload, store, and share images directly from their own server, without relying on third-party services. Inspired by the functionality of platforms like Imgur and Pastebin, Picsur focuses on offering a clean and efficient experience for users who need a straightforward way to manage images online.\n\n\nUnlike more complex photo management solutions such as PhotoPrism or Immich, which include features like facial recognition, albums, and AI-assisted sorting, Picsur is purpose-built for quick uploads and direct sharing. It supports a wide range of image formats, including common ones like JPEG, PNG, and GIF, as well as newer or less standard types such as QOI and animated WebP files. Once uploaded, images can be edited with basic tools such as resizing, rotating, flipping, or applying grayscale and negative effects.\n\n\nThe platform includes a user-friendly web interface that supports drag-and-drop uploads and provides direct links for sharing images instantly. Administrators can access a backend panel to manage uploaded files and user permissions, offering full control over how the service operates.\n\n\nBecause Picsur is self-hosted, it ensures maximum privacy and independence from cloud providers. This makes it an ideal solution for individuals or small teams looking to host images privately, efficiently, and with minimal overhead.",

        "description": "⚠️ PrivateBin requires HTTPS and exposure to the public internet to work. The easiest way to do this is with the Cloudflare Tunnel app or Nginx Proxy Manager app on the Umbrel App Store.\n\n\nPrivateBin is an open-source, minimalist, and encrypted pastebin service.\nIt allows users to share text or code snippets securely, with end-to-end encryption, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read the contents.\nThe server hosting PrivateBin cannot decrypt or access the data being shared, providing a high level of privacy.\n\n\nHere are some key features of PrivateBin:\n\n\n🔒 End-to-End Encryption: All data is encrypted in the browser before it's sent to the server. The server never sees the unencrypted content.\n\n\n🔥 Expiration and Burn-After-Reading: Users can set expiration times for their pastes, or opt for a \"burn-after-reading\" option where the content self-destructs after a single viewing.\n\n\n👤 No User Accounts: PrivateBin doesn't require user registration or authentication, making it ideal for anonymous sharing of sensitive information.\n\n\n🛡️ Password Protection: Users can add an extra layer of security by setting a password for the paste.\n\n\n📜 Syntax Highlighting: PrivateBin supports syntax highlighting for programming languages, making it useful for sharing code snippets.\n\n\n🏠 Self-Hosted: As a self-hosted solution, PrivateBin offers full control over where the data is stored and the ability to integrate it with various server environments.\n\n\n🚫 No Metadata: Unlike some other pastebin services, PrivateBin doesn't store IP addresses or any identifiable metadata about users or pastes.\n\n\nIt's popular in privacy-conscious communities for securely sharing snippets without leaving a trace.",

        "description": "📄 Readur is a powerful and modern document management system designed to help individuals and teams efficiently organize, process, and access their digital documents. It combines a high-performance backend with a sleek and intuitive web interface to deliver a smooth and reliable user experience.\n\n\nUsers can easily upload various types of files such as PDFs, images, text documents, and Office files using a simple drag and drop method. One of the key strengths of Readur is its advanced optical character recognition technology which automatically extracts text from scanned documents and images. This OCR functionality enables users to transform otherwise static or image-based files into searchable content, greatly enhancing the ability to locate information within documents.\n\n\nThe system continuously monitors designated folders for new files, processing them in a non-destructive way that preserves the original data. Once processed, the documents become fully searchable thanks to sophisticated full-text search capabilities supported by a robust database. This search feature includes powerful filtering and ranking mechanisms that make finding relevant documents fast and precise.\n\n\nSecurity is a priority in Readur, with user authentication handled through secure token-based methods and strong password hashing. The user interface is built to be responsive and visually appealing, focusing on ease of use and productivity.\n\n\nOverall, Readur leverages intelligent OCR and efficient document processing to provide a seamless experience for managing large volumes of documents while ensuring quick access to the information that matters most.",

        "description": "RustDesk is an open-source, self-hosted, and secure remote desktop solution that allows users to access and control computers remotely. It provides functionality similar to other remote desktop tools like TeamViewer and AnyDesk but with the key advantage of being open-source, meaning users can inspect the code, contribute to its development, and even self-host the software on their own servers. This allows for greater control over the remote access environment and better privacy, as all communication can be routed through a server that the user owns or operates, rather than relying on a third-party provider.\n\n\nRustDesk is built using Rust, a systems programming language known for its performance, security, and memory safety. The software is lightweight and designed for ease of use, featuring an intuitive interface that makes remote desktop access accessible to both technical and non-technical users. It supports cross-platform functionality, meaning you can connect from Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android devices to control a remote machine. RustDesk offers essential features such as file transfer, clipboard synchronization, and screen sharing, ensuring a seamless experience for users needing remote assistance or working from different locations.\n\n\nOne of the major benefits of RustDesk is its ability to function without relying on centralized servers. While it does offer a cloud service for convenience, users can set up their own server infrastructure, enhancing the security and privacy of their remote sessions. With this self-hosted option, users can have complete control over the data transmitted between the devices, which is ideal for individuals or organizations that prioritize privacy and data protection.\n\n\nOverall, RustDesk provides a powerful alternative to proprietary remote desktop software. Its open-source nature, self-hosting capability, and high performance make it an appealing choice for anyone seeking a reliable, secure, and customizable remote desktop solution.",

        "description": "🔍 SearXNG is a metasearch engine that enables users to search the internet by combining results from multiple search providers into one comprehensive list. When a user submits a query, SearXNG sends that query simultaneously to a variety of external search engines and services. It then collects and merges the responses, presenting the user with a unified set of search results. This approach allows users to access a wider range of information from different sources without having to search each one individually.\n\n\nThe application emphasizes delivering diverse and balanced search outcomes by aggregating results from many different platforms. By pooling these various results, SearXNG helps reduce bias that might come from relying on a single search engine, offering users a more neutral and varied perspective on their search topics. The system is designed to handle many types of searches, from web pages to images, videos, news, and other categories, depending on which providers are queried.\n\n\nIn addition, SearXNG is built to respect user privacy by not storing search histories or personal data. This means that every search is treated independently, and no personal tracking or profiling takes place. The anonymity of searches helps users feel more secure when looking up information online. Overall, SearXNG functions as a powerful tool for searching by leveraging the strengths of multiple search engines while protecting user privacy and promoting an open, unbiased search experience.",

It provides a sleek and user-friendly interface that makes uploading and organizing visual content both simple and efficient. Instead of depending on third-party services, Slink puts the user in charge of their own image collection, ensuring that every upload remains private and secure unless shared intentionally.\n\n\nThe platform supports a wide range of image formats, including standard and high-efficiency types, allowing for seamless handling of all kinds of media files. Uploaded images can be automatically optimized through compression and metadata removal, ensuring fast loading times while protecting sensitive information that might be embedded in files. This approach combines convenience with privacy, making Slink suitable for both personal use and professional environments that demand confidentiality.\n\n\nBeyond simple image hosting, Slink includes a powerful management system for users and permissions. Administrators can require approval for new users, enforce password strength policies, and limit upload sizes to maintain security and stability. Each shared image can be linked with unique URLs, making it easy to distribute visuals while retaining full control over access.\n\n\nSlink is built around the idea of ownership and transparency. It avoids unnecessary complexity, focusing instead on reliability, performance, and user experience. Whether used to share creative work, manage internal visual assets, or store personal collections, Slink offers a clean and responsible way to host and share images with complete peace of mind.",

        "description": "Synapse is an open source Matrix homeserver implementation, written and maintained by Element. Matrix is the open standard for secure and interoperable real time communications.\n\n\n💡 How It Works\n\n\nTo chat using Matrix, you'll need a client. You can find a list of popular clients here: https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients/\n\n\nIn Matrix, each user operates one or more Matrix clients, which connect to a Matrix homeserver. The homeserver stores all personal chat history and user account information, similar to how a mail client connects to an IMAP/SMTP server.\nLike email, you can either run your own Matrix homeserver to control and own your communications and history, or use a hosted server (e.g., matrix.org). Matrix has no single point of control or mandatory service provider, unlike WhatsApp, Facebook, Hangouts, etc.\n\n\n🛠️ Connecting a Client\n\n\nTo get started, install the \"Element\" app on your Umbrel, or install any other Matrix client on a device of your choice. When you register or login through the client, you will need to change the address of the homeserver you are logging into from the default matrix.org to http://umbrel.local:8008 for local access. \n\n\nFor seamless connection even when your client isn't connected to the same network as your Umbrel, simply install the \"Tailscale\" app on your Umbrel and your client device, and use http://umbrel:8008 as the address of your server.",

        "description": "💻 Termix is designed to simplify server administration by bringing powerful management tools into a single, unified interface. At its core, it provides direct access to SSH terminals inside the browser, eliminating the need for external clients. Sessions can be opened in tabs or arranged in split screens, allowing administrators to multitask and manage different systems simultaneously with ease. The terminal experience is responsive and reliable, ensuring that routine tasks such as configuration, updates, and troubleshooting can be performed quickly.\n\n\nBeyond terminal access, Termix offers advanced tunnel management that enables secure and persistent connections between servers and services. These tunnels can be created, monitored, and automatically reconnected when necessary, giving administrators confidence that critical links remain available without constant manual intervention. This feature is particularly useful for maintaining stable communication in environments where connections may drop or need to be reestablished frequently.\n\n\nFile management is another key aspect of Termix. Remote directories can be navigated as if they were local, with support for uploading new files, renaming or deleting existing ones, and editing content directly within the interface. The built-in editor provides syntax highlighting for various programming and configuration languages, making it easy to adjust configuration files or scripts without relying on separate tools. This seamless integration reduces friction and speeds up everyday maintenance tasks.\n\n\nTo support the handling of multiple servers, Termix includes a host manager where connections can be organized and grouped. Tags and folders make it simple to categorize different environments, whether they are development, staging, or production systems. This structure ensures that administrators can quickly find and connect to the right host without sifting through long lists of saved credentials.\n\n\nAnother significant capability of Termix is real-time monitoring. The application presents detailed statistics on system resources, including processor load, memory usage, and storage consumption. These insights help administrators understand the current state of their infrastructure and identify potential issues before they develop into critical problems.\n\n\nAll of these features are wrapped in a clean and modern interface that prioritizes usability. The design emphasizes clarity and efficiency, enabling both experienced administrators and newcomers to interact with complex systems in a straightforward way. Termix transforms server management from a fragmented set of tools into a cohesive, accessible, and user-friendly experience.",

        "description": "🧅 Tor Browser is a powerful tool designed to provide anonymous, secure, and private access to the internet. Built on Mozilla Firefox and optimized for privacy, Tor Browser uses the Tor network (The Onion Router) to protect users' identities and locations by encrypting and relaying their internet traffic through multiple nodes across the globe. This process, known as “onion routing,” conceals users' IP addresses, making it extremely difficult for websites, advertisers, or surveillance entities to track browsing activities or pinpoint locations.\n\n\nFor those who value privacy or face restrictive internet environments, Tor Browser offers key privacy features. It blocks cookies, trackers, and fingerprinting technologies that typically monitor users across websites, and it clears browsing history and cookies automatically with each session. This ensures a high degree of anonymity and safeguards against data collection in ways that standard browsers cannot.\n\n\nIn addition to enhanced privacy, Tor Browser enables unrestricted access to the open web, allowing users to bypass local censorship and reach content that may otherwise be blocked in certain regions or networks. While some trade-offs include slightly slower browsing speeds due to multi-node routing, Tor Browser is one of the most effective tools for secure, uncensored internet access. It empowers users to explore the internet freely and confidently, supporting a safer, more private online experience.\n\n\nℹ️ For Raspberry Pi and other ARM devices, use the older unofficial community port (version 13.0.9), as no official release is currently provided by the Tor Project.",

This app will install the Express proxy and configure it\nto point at your Umbrel's Bitcoin full node. Using this, you can configure a\nBitcoin provider on a ship (even one running on your Umbrel) and configure it,\nor other ships to point their wallets at it.\n\n\nThis app also provides an information GUI web page, with instructions on connecting your provider ship and Bitcoin wallet. The web UI is accessible at port 9090.

Here's how to do it:\n\n- Ensure your Umbrel is accessible over Tor by going to Settings in your dashboard and toggling \"Remote Tor access\" to enabled. You will need to restart your Umbrel if Remote Tor access was previously disabled.\n\n- Access your umbrel through a Tor browser using the .onion address shown in Settings under \"Remote Tor access\". \n\n- In your Tor browser, open the Vaultwaden app and create an account.\n\n- Once you've created an account, you can connect your Vaultwarden server from any Bitwarden app (mobile, desktop, browser, etc) by adding your server IP details.\n\n- For the most robust connection from anywhere, install Tailscale on your Umbrel and your devices, and use the Tailscale IP address to connect to your Vaultwarden server.\n\n\n*Please note that Vaultwarden is not associated with the Bitwarden® project nor 8bit Solutions LLC. When using this app, please report any bugs or suggestions to us directly, regardless of whatever clients you are using (mobile, desktop, browser, etc), and do not use Bitwarden®'s official support channels.",

        "description": "🦾 Wingfit is a focused and thoughtfully designed fitness application that enables users to take full control of their workout routines and long-term training progress. At its core, the app provides a seamless way to create, customize, and log workouts, whether you're engaged in weightlifting, running, calisthenics, or any other type of physical activity. Users can define their own exercises and organize them into workout sessions that reflect their unique training style. Every detail of a workout can be recorded, including sets, repetitions, weights, distances, times, rest periods, and notes, allowing for precise and meaningful tracking.\n\n\nThe app also supports the tracking of personal records, so users can set performance benchmarks and see how they evolve over time. A dedicated timeline view displays a history of all logged workouts, making it easy to identify patterns, spot gaps, and maintain consistency. Wingfit encourages structured progress with tools that support progressive overload and habit formation, without enforcing rigid templates or fixed routines.\n\n\nUnlike many fitness apps that overwhelm with gamification, notifications, or social feeds, Wingfit is intentionally minimalistic and distraction-free. It is built for people who are serious about their training and want a clear, intuitive interface to support their physical goals. The experience centers around empowering users to reflect on their performance, make data-driven adjustments, and grow at their own pace. With flexible logging, strong visualization of past progress, and full control over the structure of each session, Wingfit is an ideal companion for athletes, hobbyists, and anyone committed to improving their fitness journey.",

        "description": "🧙 Wizarr is an application created to streamline the process of managing and onboarding users for media servers. It provides a centralized system that allows administrators to generate invitation links, which can be shared with new users to grant them access to the server. This process eliminates the need for manual setup and reduces administrative overhead, making it easier to manage multiple users efficiently. The application ensures that every new user receives guidance through the setup process, helping them configure their clients and connect to the server in a straightforward manner.\n\n\nThe app also offers a system for tracking invitations and user activity, giving administrators detailed insights into who has joined, when they joined, and how they interact with the server. This tracking allows for better management of access permissions, including options for temporary memberships or restricted access levels. By monitoring activity and requests, Wizarr ensures that the server remains organized and that users receive the appropriate level of access and support.\n\n\nIn addition, Wizarr integrates with various platforms and communication tools to automate certain tasks, such as sending notifications or coordinating user onboarding. It supports a guided onboarding experience, providing clear instructions and steps to ensure that users can navigate the server environment without confusion. This reduces support requests and makes the user experience smoother and more intuitive.\n\n\nOverall, Wizarr is focused on making user management seamless, efficient, and transparent. It provides administrators with the tools to monitor interactions, handle requests, and maintain control over access, while giving users an easy and structured way to join and use the server. By combining invitation management, activity tracking, and automated guidance, Wizarr enhances the overall server experience for both administrators and users.",

        "description": "🎬 Yamtrack is an open-source self-hosted media tracking application designed to help users organize and keep track of a wide range of entertainment content including movies, TV shows, anime, manga, video games, books, and comics. It provides a comprehensive platform where users can record detailed information about their media consumption such as ratings, viewing status, progress, start and end dates, and personal notes. Every action performed within the application is logged, enabling users to maintain a history of their interactions such as adding new media, starting to watch or read, and resuming paused content.\n\n\nOne of the notable features of Yamtrack is its flexibility in managing both automatically imported data from popular services and manually created entries for media items that might not be available through external APIs. This allows for a personalized and complete tracking experience. Users can organize their tracked media into custom lists and share these collections with others, enhancing community interaction. A calendar view provides an overview of upcoming releases, keeping users informed about new content relevant to their interests. Notifications can be configured through various platforms such as Discord, Telegram, Slack, and email using Apprise, allowing users to stay updated on new releases or other significant events.\n\n\nYamtrack supports multiple users, each with their own accounts and personalized tracking data, making it suitable for households or small groups of media enthusiasts. Integration with Jellyfin enables automatic tracking of episodes once they are watched, seamlessly connecting media playback with tracking data.

        "description": "Expose your apps to the internet easily and securely. \n\n\n⚠️ Be cautious when exposing apps to the public internet. Ensure they have proper security, such as login protection, and avoid exposing sensitive apps without adequate safeguards. \n  \n\n🔧 Zoraxy Proxy Manager uses port 41080 for HTTP (unsecured) traffic and port 41443 for HTTPS (secured) traffic. \nTo make your apps accessible from the public internet, you will need to set up port forwarding on your router. \nForward external port 80 (HTTP) to internal port 41080 and external port 443 (HTTPS) to internal port 41443. \n\n\nZoraxy is a powerful, user-friendly reverse proxy server and forwarding tool, designed to provide a straightforward, flexible, and secure method for managing web traffic within home labs and developer environments. Written in Go, Zoraxy caters to both novice and experienced users by simplifying the process of routing HTTP requests to backend servers, enabling efficient and reliable service management without relying on traditional, more complex servers like NGINX or Apache.\n\n\nKey Features:\n\n\n🔀 Reverse Proxy & WebSocket Support: Zoraxy handles HTTP/2 connections and automatically supports WebSocket proxying, making it ideal for real-time applications that need a stable, low-latency connection, such as chat services or dashboards. It also enables reverse proxying across virtual directories and supports alias hostnames and custom headers for enhanced flexibility.\n\n\n🤖 TLS/SSL with ACME Automation: Zoraxy simplifies the setup of HTTPS using ACME, which enables automatic renewal of SSL certificates through providers like Let's Encrypt. This feature supports both SNI (Server Name Indication) and SAN (Subject Alternative Name) certificates, helping users serve multiple domains securely with minimal manual intervention.\n\n\n📍 Geo-IP Blacklisting and Whitelisting: Security is enhanced by offering geo-IP and IP-based blacklisting and whitelisting, allowing users to restrict access based on location or specific IP addresses. This feature is especially useful for protecting applications and services from specific regions or untrusted IPs.\n\n\n🌐 Global Area Network Controller & ZeroTier Integration: For distributed networks, Zoraxy provides a built-in controller interface for managing ZeroTier networks, facilitating secure and scalable connections across multiple nodes. This feature is particularly valuable for homelab enthusiasts and developers creating private network setups with limited external access​ Zoraxy DEV Community.\n\n\n🛠️ Built-in Utilities: Zoraxy goes beyond traditional reverse proxy functionality, including utilities like CIDR IP conversion, an mDNS scanner for local network discovery, and tools for debugging proxy connections. A Web-SSH terminal allows remote management of connected devices within the network, and its Wake-on-LAN support further extends Zoraxy's usability for network administrators.\n\n\n📊 Stream Proxying & Monitoring: Beyond HTTP/HTTPS, Zoraxy supports TCP and UDP stream proxying, making it a versatile choice for handling various data streams. Integrated uptime monitoring and non-personalized traffic analytics provide insights into network activity without cookies, enhancing privacy and enabling users to track service performance directly within Zoraxy.\n\n\n🖥️ Simple UI & Integration: The Zoraxy interface is designed to be intuitive, with in-depth setup instructions for less experienced users. Advanced configurations can disable authentication to integrate with existing infrastructures that use permission management. Additionally, a single-admin management mode makes it easy to operate within private networks, similar to managing a home router.\n\n\nZoraxy is particularly popular in the homelab and developer communities for its extensive feature set, reliability, and open-source nature. It can be run on low-power devices, making it suitable for a variety of hosting environments, from personal setups to larger, distributed network architectures. Its flexibility, combined with a robust feature set, makes it a compelling choice for anyone looking to streamline their network management setup or host web services securely and efficiently.",
